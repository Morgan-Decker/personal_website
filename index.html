          <h3>Fintech</h3>
          <p>
            I am interested in working in fintech due to my strong numerical
            problem solving skills on top of the wide range of sectors which
            the financial sector infuences. I have gained experience through
            attending insight weeks held by companies concerned with investment
            banking. I also keep up with the stock market
            in my spare time and manage my own investment portfolio.

          <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            After contributing to a PHD project in computational neuroscience,
            I have falled in love with data analysis. I am interested in data analysis due to the wide range of sub-topics
            and applications, both technical and non technical. I love to find
            relationships between variables and make deductions on why people
            or systems behave the way they do numerically. In my free time, I
            take a machine learning crash course created by google.

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            Although I do not have practical experience, this is an area I enjoy persuing
            in my spare time. I have written a research paper as part of my EPQ
            on the history of ethical hacking, as well as delivered a 30 minute
            presentation of the field. Furthermore, I enjoy finding vunrabilties
            in websites (legally).

          <h3>Game Development</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, I have been involved with multiple 2D game development projects.
            Unfortunatly, most of my work is under NDA, but I would love to have
            an oppertunity to explore the games development industry in a commercial setting
            Gaming is one of my main hobbys. I have played rocket league at a regional level,
            winning both in person and online tournaments. Due to my many years of Experience,
            I not only am passionate about the field, but also have a strong grasp
            of the gaming community.

      <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">About Me</h2>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Developer in Glasgow University</p>

      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>As a child, I grew up in the middle east which gave me a natural urge to explore and experience as much as life has to offer. This lead to a number of memorable experiences such as exploring the world, flying planes with the combined cadet force's royal air force, playing squash around Scotland as apart of Tayside and Fife's junior excellence squad, and playing competitive video games in front of tens to thousands of in person and online spectators.</p>
        <p>This curiosity also translates into my technical experiences. I love exporing technology and learning all it has to offer, especially with computing. Wether it be front end, back end, design, devops, or anything else, I want to learn all about it. The primary motivation for learning to program is that even small simple programs can have a massive impact on the world. I want to write software which makes a difference to peoples lives, such as automating menail tasks or helping people navigate a difficult important decision. This philosiphy has lead me to work on exciting projects, such as analysing brain waves for emotional analysis on a PHD research project or developing educational games for both the education and commercial sectors.</p>
        <p>If you have oppertunites, experiences, or advice you would like to share please do get in touch! I would love to hear about it!</p>
