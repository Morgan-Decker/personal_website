      As a junior, I was invited to play squash competitively for my region as part of the junior excellence program.
      This involved traveling around scotland, playing with the highest rated juniors in my region.
      I won 2 regional A grade tournaments, and runner up in an A grade and B grade tournament.
    </p>

    <p>
      While playing in school, I was the only person who was interested in squash.
      I obtained a coaching qualification and took it upon myself to build a squash community.
      In the space of a season, I grew the club to twenty members, 5 of which were invited to play at a regional level.
      We won 6 trophies as a team over the season, and squash became an established popular sport in my school.
      I was honored to be titled squash captian and champion, as well as recieve a distinction for sporting achievement.
    </p>

    <p>
      I now play and coach squash for my university team.
      I also have sponserships for both playing and coaching squash.
      I have also coached in an outreach programme, encouraging kids to try squash.
